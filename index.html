<p>The Super Deduper is a C/C++ application that was created to remove PCR duplicates from high throughput sequencing data. First I will give an overview on installation then go over how to run it and how it works. If you run into any problems or have any questions, please, submit an issue on the github page. I hope you find this application useful in your research. </p>

<p>Here is the basic installation and basic use case of the Super Deduper. It has been tested on Linux as well as OS X. </p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:dstreett/Super-Deduper.git
$ cd Super-Deduper
$ make
$ echo "Example of Paired End inputs (Two files [-1 and -2] and Interleaved [-i])"
$ ./super_deduper -1 ./examples/phix_example_PE1 -2 ./examples/phix_example_PE2
$ ./super_deduper -i ./examples/interleaved_example.fastq.gz
$ echo "Example of Single End Reads [-U]"
$ ./super_deduper -U ./examples/phix_example_SE.fastq.gz
</code></pre>


<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Super Deduper Works</h3>

<p>
The Super Deduper turns a region of the sequence (or the entire sequence) into a binary number. It does this by mapping A to 00, T to 11, C to 01, and G to 10.
Super deduper concatenates read 1's and read 2's binary numbers together and creates a unique ID for the pair that is then used to determine duplications in a binary search tree. With single end reads the same thing happens, except there is no read 2 to concatenate with.
Both the read and the reverse compliment are tested for - however, only the larger of the two are kept. Doing this ensures that the reverse compliment is tested for and that all reads that are duplicates (be in a reverse compliment duplicate) are tested and mapped to the same unique ID.
A node is created in this tree if a new sequence ID is seen. If an ID is all ready seen a summation of the quality score of the entire read is taken. The read with the higher summation is taken.
The reason for a summation versus an average is summations give preferential treatment to longer reads as well as higher quality scores.

<a id="arguements" class="anchor" href="#arguemnts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Arguements and what they do</h3>

<p>
Here are the basic arguements
</p>


<pre>

<p>If you are doing paired end reads (that aren't interleaved)</p?
<code>
-1, --read1 [path to read 1 (fastq or fastq.gz)]
-2, --read2 [path to read 2 (fastq or fastq.gz)]
</code>
If you want to use an interleaved file - no problem
<code>
-i, --interleaved-input <path to interleaved file>
</code>
Additionally, single ends are handled just fine
<code>
-U, --singleend <path to single end file> 
</code>
All these options can be comma seperated to add multiple files.

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
